## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Blue (#3498db), chosen to inspire trust, and to align the product with SaaS conventions. The hue is shifted somewhat more toward azure than is typical.
- Accent color: Green (#2ecc71) for CTAs, chosen for clarity.
- Background color: Light Gray (#ecf0f1), to visually evoke a clean workspace. Desaturated and fairly bright.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look.
- Use minimalist line icons for different file types (e.g., PDF, DOC, PNG).
- Implement a sidebar navigation alongside a responsive grid or table for managing file structures.
- Include optional dark mode for power users.
